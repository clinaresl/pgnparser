# Introduction #

This tool parses PGN files, shows a summary review of its contents, sort and
filter games by any criteria, and produce histograms on any piece of data. In
addition, it also generates LaTeX files that can be processed with `pdflatex` or
`xelatex` to generate pdf files with the contents of the games in any PGN file.

While it can be used for any PGN files, it is specifically designed to parse and
process the PGN files generated by [Lichess](https://lichess.org) and also
games from the [FICS database](http://www.ficsgames.org).

`pgnparser` has been conceived as a command-line tool. However, it also provides
an easy API to be used by other programmers who want to import this module.
Special care has been put into the documentation style so that `go doc` provides
reliable and accurate information to use this module as a third-party software.

# External dependencies #

`pgnparser` uses the following third-party libraries

+ [expr](https://github.com/expr-lang/expr) library to parse statements written
  in Go. Indeed, this library made a huge difference in the development of
  `pgnparser`
  
+ [table](https://github.com/clinaresl/table) is used to generate fancy tables
  on the console output

These modules are automatically installed when following the directives given
under **Install**.


# Install #

To install this program for development in Go:

``` sh
   $ go get -v github.com/clinaresl/pgnparser
```

To install an executable in your system using the Go toolchain:

``` sh
   $ go install github.com/clinaresl/pgnparser
```

# Usage #

`pgnparser` has a mandatory argument, `--file`, that must be used to provide a
path to a PGN file. If no more directives are given, `pgnparser` prints out
general information.

It also honours other optional arguments:

+ `list`: generates a table with information of every game parsed.

+ `play`: generates a table on the standard output where every game is played.
  It must be given an argument `nbplies`. The table shows a sequence of moves
  along with the resulting table every `nbplies` played.
  
  Even if this argument is not given, all games found in the input pgn parser
  are played to verify correctness. If a pgn game could not be properly parsed
  an error is produced and execution halts.
  
+ `filter`: generates a new pgn file with those games in the input pgn file
  satisfying the input criteria. Filtering criteria are described below.
  
+ `sort`: generates a new pgn file where games are sorted according to the given
  criteria. Sorting criteria are described below.
  
+ `histogram`: generates a table with a summary of information about the given
  variables. Histogram variables are described below.

Because some of these options can generate new files (namely, `--filter` and
`--sort`), it is possible to provide the directive `--output` with the name of
the pgn file to generate. If none is given, the file `output.pgn` is produced
overwritting its previous contents in case the file already exists.

All in all, `pgnparser` has been designed with flexibility of use in mind.
Sorting/filtering criteria and histogram variables result from this approach.
Also, tables produced with the directive `list` or LaTeX files can use different
templates affecting the look&feel of the output. To modify the design of the
table shown with `list` a new template can be provided with `table` and the path
to the template to use. To generate a LaTeX file it just suffices to provide a
path to the LaTeX template to use with `latex`.

These options can be used simultaneously. If so:

1. First, games found in the input pgn file are listed when using `list`, i.e.,
   `list` takes precedence over all the other arguments. If a value was given to
   `table` then the given template is used to generate the table.
  
2. If `play` is given along with a strictly positive value, all games found in
   the pgn file are played and the output is shown in tabular form on the output
   console.
  
2. If `filter` is given, games satisfying the given criteria are selected for
   the next operations ---including the generation of an output pgn file.
   
3. If `sort`is given, the current collection of games is sorted according to the
   given criteria ---either all games found in the input pgn file or those
   filtered when used in conjunction with `filter`
   
4. The current collection of games (either sorted and/or filtered or not), can
   be examined to produce a summary of information with `histogram` in the end

5. Finally, in case `latex` is used, the current collection of games is used to
   generate a LaTeX file showing its contents.

## Listing games ##

Using `list` to provide information about the games found in a pgn file:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --list
```

produces the following output:

## Playing games ##

Games can be automatically played on the console. When using `play` with a
strictly positive argument a table is generated with the result of playing every
single game found in the input file where each game is started with information
given in the tags of the pgn file and then every row shows a number of moves and
the resulting board. The number of moves shown is the argument given to `play`.

For example, to play all games found in a pgn file every 30 plies:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --play 30
```

produces an outcome like the following:

``` asciidoc

```

for every game found in the input pgn file. 

**Note**: All tables use UTF-8 characters which might not be rendered properly
in this view, i.e., the view on your console might be more beautiful than the
one rendered here.

## Filtering criteria ##

PGN files always start with a header and a set of tags that can be used for
filtering games. A filtering criteria just consists of an evaluable expression
in Go (which for the purpose here is much the same like almost any programming
language) that uses variables, either appearing in the header of the PGN file or
implemented by `pgnparser` ---described below.

For example,

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --filter 'ECO=="C25"'
```

generates a pgn file named `output.pgn` with those games in the input pgn file
with `ECO=C25`. Note that the argument to `filter` is given between single
quotes because the evaluation of an expression in Go expects strings to be given
between double quotes. Variables can be combined in any way, e.g.:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --filter 'ECO=="C25" && ((White=="clinares" && Result=="0-1") || (Black=="clinares" && Result=="1-0"))'
```


returns all games with opening C25 that were lost either with black or white by
one specific player.

`pgnparser` provides an additional variable, `Moves` which is reminiscent of
`PlyCount` used in FICS. Because this variable is not provided by lichess, it is
computed on the fly. It is a numerical variable and thus:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --filter 'Moves<40 && ((White=="clinares" && Result=="0-1") || (Black=="clinares" && Result=="1-0"))'
```

filters all games lost by one specific player with either color in less than 40
moves ---or plies.

Note that the argument `--list` takes precedence over `filter` so that no
information is shown on the console of the result of filtering games. To see the
result use:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --list
```
providing the name of the output file given to the precedence invocation of `pgnparser`


## Sorting criteria ##

Sorting criteria consists of a semicolon-separated string of different variables
(either those appearing in the tags of the pgn games or those provided by
`pgnparser`) preceded each by either `<` (for *ascending* order) or `>` ---for
*descending* order. For example to generate a pgn file showing first the most
recently played games and then breaking ties in ascending order of the number of
moves:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --sort ">Date;<Moves"
```

Note that the argument `--list` takes precedence over `sort` so that no
information is shown on the console of the result of sorting games. To see
the result use:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --list
```
providing the name of the output file given to the precedence invocation of `pgnparser`

## Histogram variables ##

`histogram` can be used to produce a summary (in tabular form) of the games in
the input pgn file. All sorts of variables can be used (either those appearing
in the tags of the games, or those provided by `pgnparser`). Histogram variables
must be given in a semicolon-separated string which uses either variables or
boolean expressions using variables:

+ For every variable given the histogram produces a count of the number of
  occurrences for every value found for the given variable
  
+ For every boolean expression given the histogram provides information on the
  frequency of every feasible outcome, either true or false. If any of these
  outcomes never takes place it is skipped in the output.

The histogram is sorted in ascending order of the values of the variables. In
case of using boolean expressions false is shown before true.

It is possible to provide an arbitrary number of istogram variables. If so,
observations are nested. For example, to produce a histogram on the number of
games won and lost with every opening found in the input pgn file:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --histogram 'ECO;((White=="clinares") && (Result=="1-0")) || ((Black=="clinares") && (Result=="0-1"))'
```

produces a table with three columns: first, the ECO is shown; next, for every
value of ECO two rows are shown and tagged as either false or true. The third
column shows the frequency of the combined occurrence for every combination of
the ECO variable and the outcome of the boolean expression.

The output histogram shows a header with the name of each variable used. When
using boolean expressions the header is the entire boolean expression given, but
this might not be very informative. It is because of this that any variable or
boolean expression can be preceded with a header and a colon just to be used in
the output table:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --histogram 'ECO Opening: ECO;Win: ((White=="clinares") && (Result=="1-0")) || ((Black=="clinares") && (Result=="0-1"))'
```

produces a much more concise table with more comprehensive names for the
headers:

**Note**: All tables use UTF-8 characters which might not be rendered properly

information is shown on the console of the result of a histogram. To see the
result use:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --list
```
providing the name of the output file given to the precedence invocation of `pgnparser`

## Gerating LaTeX files ##

If the argument `latex` is given along with a path to a latex template, then a
LaTeX file is generated which is named after the value given to `outuput`
(`output.pgn` by default) with suffix `.tex`. The latest release of `pgnparser`
contains various templates. For example, to produce a detailed view of the
contents of a pgn file use:

``` sh
    $ pgnparser --file ... --latex templates/report/lichess/tabular.tpl
```

(note there are different templates for lichess and fics as they use different
variables)

which generates a document with two parts. First, it shows an index to every
game (which might span several pages) with a link shown in the first column. The
second part shows the result of playing every game in tabular form showing the
board every 8 plies. The transcription of the game contains all comments found
in the input pgn file and it also recognizes other *special* comments such as
the *emt* (elapsed move time) used in FICS which is shown separately. The
resulting LaTeX file when being processed twice shows first an index to all
games in the pgn file:

![image info](./images/sample-1.png)

Clicking on any of the links shown in red in the left column will takes the
reader to the selected game, e.g., clicking on #2 immediately shows a different
page displaying the following:

![image info](./images/sample-2.png)

This page also contains various links:

+ The world symbol shown above the main header will automatically take you to
  the web page in lichess showing this game with all tools enabled for analyzing
  the game and playing alternative lines
  
+ The links shown in blue in the footer will take you to the homepages of each
  software project

Of course, these links are specific to the template being used, and different
layouts can be produced with different templates. Importantly, some templates
might require external files as in the case of the template used in the example
above (`lichess/tabular.tpl`) which requires an image of the lichess icon. In
case any template requires any external file these are given under the directory
`latex` ---and can be freely replaced by others if needed.

Note that variables used in the templates might contain UTF-8 characters as they
are read from the input pgn file. Fortunately, `xelatex` provides automatic
conversion from UTF-8 characters to LaTeX symbols.
