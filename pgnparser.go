 Expressions are a powerful mechanism to filter games in a PGN file. They consist of
 logical expressions made of relational groups. 

 A relational group consists of two terms related by any of the relational operators 

                        <=, <, =, !=, >, >=, in, not_in

 where a term can be either a constant or a variable. 'in' and 'not_in' can be
 used only with string constants and they serve to verify whether the left term
 is a substring (or not) of the right term. 

 Constants can be either integer (such as 40) or strings (such as '1-0'). Note
 that strings have to be single quoted. Variables are preceded by the character
 '%'. Any tag appearing in the header of a PGN game can be used as a variable
 such as '%White' or '%WhiteElo'.

 Logical expressions consist of relational groups related by any of the logical 
 operators:

                                  and, or

 where 'and' has precedence over 'or'. To modify the precedence rules, parenthesis
 can be freely used. 

 Note that the names of variables and the logical operators are case sensitive.


 Examples:

 The file 'examples/ficsgamesdb_search_1255777.pgn', contains 2564 different
 games played between January, 1, 2015 and June, 5, 2015. The following query:

    $ ./pgnparser --file examples/ficsgamesdb_search_1255777.pgn
                  --select "%Date <= '2015.01.31' and %Date >= '2015.01.01'"

 filters those games played during January. In total, 805 games. An alternative
 way to filter the same games is shown below:


    $ ./pgnparser --file examples/ficsgamesdb_search_1255777.pgn
                  --select "'2015.01' in %Date"

 To know how many won games are stored in the file by a specific player (in the
 example *clinares*):

    $ ./pgnparser --file examples/ficsgamesdb_search_1255777.pgn
                  --select "(%White = 'clinares' and %Result = '1-0') or 
                            (%Black = 'clinares' and %Result = '0-1')"

 which returns 1229 games.

 To know the number of games won/lost with ECO code C25 by the same player:

    $ ./pgnparser --file examples/ficsgamesdb_search_1255777.pgn
                  --select "((%White = 'clinares' and %Result = '1-0') or 
                             (%Black = 'clinares' and %Result = '0-1')) and
                            %ECO='C25'"

 returns 160 won games, and:

    $ ./pgnparser --file examples/ficsgamesdb_search_1255777.pgn
                  --select "((%White = 'clinares' and %Result = '0-1') or 
                             (%Black = 'clinares' and %Result = '1-0')) and
                            %ECO='C25'"

 returns 140 games.

// shows informmation on sorting descriptors acknowledged by the directive
// --sort
func showSortingDescriptors(signal int) {

	fmt.Println(` 
 Games can be sorted according to different criteria either in ascending or
 descending order. The keys to use are given as a string which consists of a
 sequence of variables (and hence, they should be preceded with the character
 '%'). A key is applied in increasing order if it is preceded by '<' and in
 decreasing order if it is given as '>'.

 Examples:

 The file 'examples/mygames.pgn', contains 5 games which can be sorted in
 increasing order of white's name as follows:

    $ ./pgnparser --file examples/mygames.pgn
                  --sort "< %White"

 In case two chess games have the same value of the key, ties can be broken
 using additional keys. For example:

    $ ./pgnparser --file examples/mygames.pgn
                  --sort "< %White > %Result"

 sorts games in increasing order of white's name and in decreasing order of the
 result for all games played by the same player as white.

 It is possible to use an arbitrary number of keys for sorting games.

func showHistogram(signal int) {

	fmt.Println(` 
 Histograms are used to produce information about the frequencies of a variable
 or a combination of two variables. This is, histograms are limited to one or
 two variables.

 Two different types of variables are recognized:

 1. Variables prefixed with the character '%' and optionally with a title: 

                             title: variable

    Variables here refer mainly to tags defined in *all* PGN games or variables
    defined automatically by this software

    If a variable is given, histograms are computed as the number of ocurrences
    of each observed value of the specified variable.

 2. Cases defined with the following syntax:

              title: (title: expression ; title: expression ...)

    i.e., as a parenthesized sequence of expressions separated by semicolons
    ---for more information on how to define propositional formulas use
    --help-expressions. Every expression can be optionally preceded by a
    title. Likewise, the whole case can be also given a name which is also
    optional.

    In this case, the histogram is computed as the number of times that each
    expression is verified. In general, only one expression should be true. In
    case that more than one expression is evaluated to true a warning is
    automatically generated.

 If only one variable is provided, the histogram simply consists of the number
 of observations of the given variable/case. If two variables are given, the
 ocurrences of the second variable/case are indexed by the value of the first
 variable. Of course, histograms are processed according to the order of the
 variables.

 If a title is given, then it is used in the report generated. Otherwise, a
 verbatim copy of the variable/case definition is printed.

 Examples:


`)
	os.Exit(signal)
}

// parse the flags and verifies that proper values were given. If not, a fatal
// error is logged
func verify() {

	// first, parse the flags ---in case help was given, it is automatically
	// handled by the flags package
	flag.Parse()

	// if version information was requested show it now and exit
	if version {
		showVersion(EXIT_SUCCESS)
	}

	// in case further assistance on a particular subject is requested, then
	// show it here and exit
	if helpExpressions {
		showExpressions(EXIT_SUCCESS)
	}
	if helpSort {
		showSortingDescriptors(EXIT_SUCCESS)
	}
	if helpHistogram {
		showHistogram(EXIT_SUCCESS)
	}

	// verify that the pgn file given exists and is accessible
	pgnisregular, _ := fstools.IsRegular(pgnfile)
	if !pgnisregular {
		log.Fatalf("the pgn file '%s' does not exist or is not accessible",
			pgnfile)
	}

	// very that the tableTemplate file exists and is accessible
	tableTemplateisregular, _ := fstools.IsRegular(tableTemplate)
	if !tableTemplateisregular {
		log.Fatalf("the table template file '%s' does not exist or is not accessible",
			tableTemplate)
	}

}

// Main body
func main() {

	// verify the values parsed
	verify()

	// process the contents of the given file
	games := pgntools.GetGamesFromFile(pgnfile, showboard, query, sort, verbose)

	// show a table with information of the games been processed. For this,
	// a template is used: tableTemplate contains the location of a default
	// template to use; others can be defined with --table
	games.GamesToWriterFromTemplate(os.Stdout, tableTemplate)

	// In case at least one histogram was given, then process it over the
	// whole collection of pgn games
	if histogram != "" {
		hist := games.ComputeHistogram(histogram)
		fmt.Printf("%v\n", &hist)
	}

	// in case a LaTeX template has been given, then generate a LaTeX file
	// with the same name than the pgn file (and in the same location) with
	// extension '.tex' from the contents given in the specified template
	if latexTemplate != "" {

		games.GamesToFileFromTemplate(pgnfile+".tex", latexTemplate)
	}
